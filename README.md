# Global Earthquake Mapping & Analysis

# Overview
Welcome to the Global Earthquake Mapping & Analysis project! This repository contains a Python application that retrieves real-time earthquake data from the USGS (United States Geological Survey) API, visualizes it on an interactive world map using Plotly, and performs data analysis to uncover insights about global seismic activity.

# Project Motivation
Understanding earthquake patterns is crucial for disaster preparedness, urban planning, insurance risk assessment, and environmental studies. This project aims to make seismic data accessible and interpretable through interactive visualizations and statistical analysis, demonstrating data analytics and visualization skills relevant for aspiring data analysts and data scientists.

# Features
Interactive Map Visualization: Displays earthquakes on a global map with markers sized and colored according to magnitude.

Geospatial Analysis: Identifies seismic hotspots and patterns related to tectonic activity.

Data Export: Option to export the processed data to CSV for further analysis.

# Technologies Used
Python 3.12.3

Plotly: For interactive data visualization.

GeoJSON: For handling geographical data.

# Data Source
USGS Earthquake Catalog API

Endpoint: USGS API

Provides real-time and historical earthquake data worldwide.

# Potential Applications
Disaster Preparedness: Helps governments and organizations allocate resources effectively.

Insurance Risk Assessment: Assists insurance companies in pricing premiums based on regional seismic activity.

Urban Planning: Informs infrastructure development and building codes in earthquake-prone areas.

Academic Research: Serves as a tool for geoscientists studying tectonic movements.

# Future Enhancements
Real-Time Data Retrieval: Fetches up-to-date earthquake data from the USGS API.

Data Filtering: Allows customization of data based on magnitude, depth, time range, and geographic location.

Statistical Analysis: Calculates key statistics such as average magnitude, depth distribution, and frequency of occurrences.

# Acknowledgments
USGS Earthquake Catalog: For providing comprehensive and accessible earthquake data.
